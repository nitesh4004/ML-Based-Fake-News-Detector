I undertook a comprehensive Machine Learning project focused on Fake News Detection. Beginning with the essential import of libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization, I progressed to data preprocessing and analysis. This involved reading datasets from CSV files and structuring them for analysis. I further refined the data by appending a new "class" column, labeling fake news as 0 and true news as 1. For manual testing purposes, I excluded the last 10 rows from each dataset, modifying the shapes accordingly. The datasets were then merged and saved as a CSV file. By leveraging Scikit-learn's model selection tools, I subsequently engineered features, split the data into training and testing sets, and employed classification models for prediction. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy score and classification reports were used to gauge model performance. This project showcased my proficiency in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques, emphasizing my ability to leverage libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and visualization tools for a robust Fake News Detection solution.

The project imports the following libraries:

pandas: This library is used to read and manipulate dataframes.
numpy: This library is used for mathematical operations.
seaborn: This library is used for data visualization.
matplotlib: This library is also used for data visualization.
sklearn.model_selection: This library is used to split the data into training and test sets.
sklearn.metrics: This library is used to evaluate the performance of the model.
re: This library is used to perform regular expression operations.
string: This library is used to perform string operations.
The project is divided into the following steps:

Import the data form keggle  (https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data)





*Clean the data.




*Split the data into training and test sets.





*Train the model.




*Evaluate the model.




*Use the model to classify new articles.




The project is still under development, but it has the potential to be a valuable tool for detecting fake news.
