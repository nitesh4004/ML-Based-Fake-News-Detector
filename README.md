The project titled "ML-Based Fake News Detector" is a machine learning model that can be used to detect fake news. The model is trained on a dataset of real and fake news articles, and it learns to identify the linguistic features that are characteristic of fake news. Once the model is trained, it can be used to classify new articles as either real or fake.

The project imports the following libraries:

pandas: This library is used to read and manipulate dataframes.
numpy: This library is used for mathematical operations.
seaborn: This library is used for data visualization.
matplotlib: This library is also used for data visualization.
sklearn.model_selection: This library is used to split the data into training and test sets.
sklearn.metrics: This library is used to evaluate the performance of the model.
re: This library is used to perform regular expression operations.
string: This library is used to perform string operations.
The project is divided into the following steps:

Import the data form keggle  (https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data)
*Clean the data.
*Split the data into training and test sets.
*Train the model.
*Evaluate the model.
*Use the model to classify new articles.
The project is still under development, but it has the potential to be a valuable tool for detecting fake news.
